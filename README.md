# Clima-Weather-API-
Clima is an app which users will be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. I benefited from open weather map API (Application Programming Interface) to build the app. There is, also, dark mode in the app. In order to create dark mode, I use vector images as image assets. Besides, I benefited from MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern in this app. to be more precise, WeatherManager, WeatherData, and WeatherModel files are in Model file. Main file is in View Folder, and WeatherViewController is located in Controller. On the other hand, I used SF symbol while desining the app such as sunny and cloudy logos.
